        <h6>Small Review of them all</h6>
        <p>1. Harry Potter is just a master piece. A creation of J.K. Rowling, the books are just as good as the movies.</p>
        <p>2. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dhal is also great! If you're into funny stories, this novel along with The Glass Elevator is perfect for you.</p>
        <p>3. The Silent Patient is a mystery, thriller book. The whole sotry with the plot twist at the end? Alex Michaelides truly made a psychological thriller. </p>
        <p>4. The Shatter Me series by Tahereh Mafi is perfect for you if you're into fiction, romance and adventure.</p>
        <p>5. And last but not least, The Wimpy Kid Series. Who doesn't know about it? It's the most funniest series ever. Perfect for tweens and teens alike.</p>
