   <p class="example2">Pizza (Italian: ['pittsa], Neapolitan: ['pittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,
    flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as
    anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally
    in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</p>
